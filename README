I wanted something that would run powershell scripts as a service easily and I never was a fan of running it with taskscheduler.
This windows service reads the path of the script and it's arguments from the app.conf file so you can run any powershell script that you want (i think).
It also redirects output and errors to eventlog and terminates itself if the script would stop running.

I have tested it on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10.
 
Tutorial

Start with downloading the current compile (link above) or compile it yourself and put it some place good.
Open PowershellStarter.exe.config in notepad
Edit ScriptPath to point to your powershell script.
Edit ScriptParameters or leave it empty if you don't have any parameters.
You can edit Eventlog and EventlogSource if you have any special preference on how you want to log it.
Start powershell as admin and enter:
New-Service -Name PowershellStarter -DisplayName PowershellStarter -BinaryPathName C:\Path\To\PowershellStarter.exe -Description "Powershellstarter service" -StartupType Automatic
"Powershellstarter" can be any name you want.
And finally:
Start-Service PowershellStarter
Done!
If anything messes up it should be visible under the application eventlog.
